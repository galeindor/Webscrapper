The founders of Encision recognized that traditional monopolar laparoscopic instruments have an inherent design flaw; they are prone to insulation failure and capacitive coupling, causing patient burns*. To address the issue they created Active Electrode Monitoring technology, which eliminates the chance of stray energy burns to patients by electrically shielding the laparoscopic surgical instrument shaft. Today Encision offers a complete line of premium laparoscopic monopolar surgical instruments with integrated AEM technology.

The Company is an ""OTC Reporting Issuer"" as that term is defined in Multilateral Instrument 51-509, Issuers Quoted in the U.S. Over-the-Counter Markets, promulgated by various Canadian provincial Securities Commissions. Accordingly, certain disclosure in this news release or other disclosure provided by the Company has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. In Canada, an issuer is required to provide technical information with respect to mineralization, including reserves and resources, if any, on its mineral exploration properties in accordance with Canadian requirements, which differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") applicable to registration statements and reports filed by United States companies pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As such, information contained in this news release or other disclosure provided by the Company concerning descriptions of mineralization under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC and not subject to Canadian securities legislation. This summary description or other disclosure provided by the Company may use the terms ""measured mineral resources"", ""indicated mineral resources"" and ""inferred mineral resources"". While these terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations (under National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects), the SEC does not recognize them. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted to reserves. In addition, ""inferred mineral resources"" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities legislation, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, although they may form, in certain circumstances, the basis of a ""preliminary economic assessment"" as that term is defined in National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.

*Cautionary Statement to U.S. Investors: The United States Securities and Exchange Commission limits disclosure for U.S. reporting purposes to mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. According to the definitions provided within SEC Industry Guide 7; the San Jose de Gracia Property currently contains No Known Reserves.

The Company's primary focus is on increasing domestic production from proven oil fields. The process began with oil field screening and selection. We pursued oil fields with a minimum of 25 million barrels of estimated recoverable oil. There are 6,500 fields in the US (with an addressable market at 18 B bbls); 14,500 fields worldwide; with 100+ stranded oil fields identified by Laredo as qualified for UGD recovery. At first when the Company acquires a targeted oil field, we will continue to operate the producing field and expect to generate revenue and profit from doing so. Then, Laredo's tool is to apply its Underground Gravity Drainage (UGD) process. The UGD method in the field starts with gaining underground access, then implementing traditional, proven underground mining machinery to drill upwards from beneath the target oil field, where closely spaced wellbores can be drilled up into the reservoir, using gravity to then drain the targeted reservoir through the wellbores. Once development of the underground chamber and the UGD method is prepared for operation, the conventional wells will be capped after UGD production has begun. A combination of increased well spacing and Gravity Drainage is used to drain the remaining mobile oil. The Hyper Down-Spacing enables accelerated production across the entire field. This method is applicable to mature oil fields that have very specific geological characteristics. This Business Process significantly increases well count and radically reduces Capital and Operating cost per bbl: $8 average cost vs. industry average of $35+ per barrel for Enhanced Oil Recovery projects. Some wells can materially increase the field oil production rate from prior periods and recover amounts of oil equal to or greater than amounts previously recovered from the mature fields selected. As such, this Business Process can produce oil equal to or greater than the historical cumulative production in the field. This solution boasts highly predictable production and high scalability. The effect of such operations should result in minimal disruption of oil production from our field investments."

The Company is in the process of implementing a multi-tiered marketing and sales strategy. The short-term emphasis is on controlled growth, utilizing indirect marketing through third-party relationships. Indirect marketing efforts, including the following, allow the Company to facilitate growth while keeping expenses low by avoiding the expense associated with creating and managing a full sales team: 

 Aggregators, Brokers, Consultants - often referred to as ABCs in the retail power industry;
 Affinity Programs - airline miles, credit card points, and participating gift cards;
 Multifamily Housing Programs - incentivizing property management companies based on referrals to their tenants;
 Referrals - reaching out to individuals connected to the community and providing incentives for sign-ups; and
 Charitable Programs - enhancing referral programs and offering customers the chance to donate referral fees to local charitable organizations.

As the Company grows, we expect to achieve long-term growth by building our in-house sales team to manage our third-party, as well as our direct marketing efforts. Our direct marketing efforts include, or will include, without limitation:

 In-house sales staff focused on small to medium sized commercial sales;
 Face-to-face marketing, including presentations, customer meetings, and business development through newly-formed relationships with consumers (a/k/a cold calling);
 Direct sales using independent sales associates;
 Responding to website inquiries from commercial businesses;
 Identifying opportunities in underserved markets (e.g. South Texas and West Texas); and
 Community Involvement - establishing our brand throughout the community by giving back and volunteering our time and assistance.

Blue Biofuels developed and patented a technology system that converts virtually any plant material -- such as grasses, wood, and farm waste like wheat straw or sugarcane bagasse -- into sugars and lignin. The sugars are subsequently processed into bio-ethanol and then sustainable aviation fuel; the lignin may be further processed into specialty chemicals or ion exchange resins. We call this the CTS process, where CTS stands for Cellulose to Sugar. CTS is an environmentally friendly, sustainable, and renewable green energy system. The process has a near zero carbon footprint in that the amount of added atmospheric carbon created by burning the cellulosic ethanol produced by the CTS system is reabsorbed/recycled by newly grown plant materials that are harvested as feedstock for the next round of cellulosic ethanol and lignin produced. The Company believes that biofuel originating from its CTS process will be eligible to receive the US EPA's generous D3 cellulosic Renewable Fuel Credits. The D3 credit has ranged between $2.36 and $3.34 since the beginning of 2022. This incentive is offered to all domestic cellulosic fuel producers whose fuel is used in the transportation industry.

Building on that technology, the company's technical team has completed an initial design for the CryoCann 500 CF system. The CryoCann 500 CF is optimized for the rapid capture (within minutes after plant harvesting) of fully intact cannabis and hemp trichomes, as well as terpenes. Rapid capture should enable cannabis and hemp producers to dramatically reduce costs, increase end-product yields and enhance product purity. The resulting sift can be warehoused for extended periods, or further processed into consumer products. The company believes that efficiencies delivered by the CryoCann 500 CF will trigger industry-wide changes in the handling and processing of harvested cannabis and hemp.

We currently sell our jewelry to approximately 150 independent jewelry retailers across the United States and have spent over $3 million in branding the Bergio name through tradeshows, trade advertising, national advertising and billboard advertising since launching the line in 1995. We have manufacturing control over our line as a result of having a manufacturing facility in New Jersey as well as subcontracts with facilities in Italy and Bangkok. It is our intention to establish Bergio International as a holding company for the purpose of acquiring established jewelry design and manufacturing firms who possess branded product lines. Branded product lines are products and/or collections whereby the jewelry manufacturers have established their products within the industry through advertising in consumer and trade magazines as well as possibly obtaining federally registered trademarks of their products and collections. This is in line with our strategy and belief that a brand name can create an association with innovation, design and quality which helps add value to the individual products as well as facilitate the introduction of new products. We intend to acquire design and manufacturing firms throughout the United States and Europe. If and when we pursue any potential acquisition candidates, we intend to target the top 10% of the world?s jewelry manufactures that have already created an identity and brand in the jewelry industry. We intend to locate potential candidates through our relationships in the industry and expect to structure the acquisition through the payment of cash, which will most likely be provided from third party financing, as well as our common stock but not cash generated from our operations. In the event we obtain financing from third parties for any potential acquisitions, Bergio International may agree to issue our common stock in exchange for the capital received. However, as of the date of this Current Report, we do not have any binding agreements with any potential acquisition candidates or arrangements with any third parties for financing. Principal Products and Services - We have historically sold our products directly to distributors, retailers and other wholesalers, who then in turn sell their products to consumers through retail stores. Independent retail jewelers that offer the current Bergio line are not under formal contracts and most sell competing products. Our products consist of a wide range of unique styles and designs made from precious metals such as gold, platinum and Karat gold, as well as other precious stones. We continuously innovate and change our designs based upon consumer trends and as a result of new designs being created we believe we are able to differentiate ourselves and strengthen our brands. We sell our products to our customers at price points that reflect the market price of the base material plus a markup reflecting our design fee and processing fees. Each year, most jewelry manufacturers bring new products to market. We believe that we are a trendsetter in jewelry manufacturing. As a result, we come out with a variety of products throughout the year that we believe have commercial potential to meet what we feel are new trends within the industry."

To date, GaN processing technology has not been able to produce a viable GaN high voltage switching transistor operating above 1,000 V. Current devices are largely horizontal conduction devices based on radio frequency (RF) designs modified to operate at high voltage. These designs are not scalable beyond 1,000 V operating voltage, which limits their use to low voltage, consumer electronics applications. Odyssey Semiconductor's unique and proprietary GaN processing technology allows for the realization of vertical current conduction GaN devices, extending application voltages from 1,000 V to over 10,000V.

About 36,668 sachets were distributed between December 2012 to September 2013 thereafter we launch a GEEC Enzyme Club Membership drive program, a lucky draw campaign ""SGD10,000 For You"". During the campaign, we succeeded to secure 750 members. As of October 31, 2014, we have 1,508 Members on our record and expected to grow.

To service our GEEC Enzyme Club Members and the consumers better, we launch the GEEC Retail Chain Store plan thus in July 2013 we established the first retail store at Suntec City Mall. On May 14, 2014, GESPL entered into a Consignment Agreement with Nature's Farm Pte Ltd to display and sale of ProCellax products at six stores / locations throughout Singapore. In September 2014, GESPL leased a pushcart store at The Star Vista. To-date GEPSL has a total of eight stores in Singapore for retailing ProCellax products. Our business plan is to have ten retail stores in Singapore in order for us to compete. At present, we are developing and improving GESPL's website for e-Commerce to cater for Singapore market electronically.

We also sell ProCellax to medical clinics in Singapore. We aim for greater sales by employing suitable sales personnel for marketing and extending credit terms to these clinics.

On June 1, 2012 Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore has advised no objection for the importation of ProAnilax into Singapore for distribution, but importation has not started. The current 20kg bulk pack packaging is not suitable for the Singapore market due to size and demand. Therefore, we plan to re-pack it into smaller packaging sizes in Sri Lanka to meet the needs of pet owners and livestock and poultry farmers in the target markets.

From our GESPL's operations, we have recorded improving revenue of $41,244 from our GESPL operations for fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 to $140,519 for fiscal period nine months ended June 30, 2014. Prospect for sales will be better when the ASEAN Vision 2020 implements the harmonised Regulatory Framework on Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements in year 2015. We have an advantage too for being ""Halal"" Certified on ProCellax products.

From December 1, 2014. GETCL as been incorporated in Bangkok - Thailand. The main objective is to re-pack our range of ProCellax in Thailand. Thus is to reduce our product cost. And, lower our retail prices to make it more affordable to the general public.

To-date, GEEC Group has 19 employees."

As a result of the enhanced speed and the fact that the accelerated aging process can occur in the barrel, Rooshine is able to cycle a single spirit through multiple barrel/wood combinations to develop unique flavors that would otherwise take decades or perhaps even centuries to produce."
